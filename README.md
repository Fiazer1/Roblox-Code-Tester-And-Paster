OOOOkay so the extension should be activated in the debug menu for addons on firefox as a temporary addon.
after this you'll can right click on any highlighted gift code on this format : XXX-XXX-XXXX (with X being numbers)
and click on "Paste Roblox Code VX.x"
and BOOM it opens a new tab on roblox's redeem page with the code in the box and presses redeem for you.

--Second Usage--
on the redeem page, click on the extension to bring the menu, press the switch and it'll test codes for you (careful tho, idk if this could get you banned if you abuse it,
it only got to a captcha for me that would prevent it from working).
